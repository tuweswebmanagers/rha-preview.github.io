					<h3>Jeff Shaner</h3>
					<h4>Chief Executive Officer</h4>
					<p>Jeff Shaner was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of Aveanna Healthcare in January of 2023. He also serves on the Board of Directors. Mr. Shaner is responsible for overseeing the company’s three operating divisions: private duty services, medical solutions, and home health and hospice. Mr. Shaner has been integral to the formation of Aveanna Healthcare and its strategy to become a leading national provider of homecare.</p>
					<p>Mr. Shaner brings broad experience to post-acute healthcare, with more than 20 years of service in key leadership positions. He began his career in the healthcare business in 2000, leading the operations at Total Care, Inc. He joined The Healthfield Group following its acquisition of Total Care and was later tapped to lead its home health division. He led the integration of eight acquired companies into Healthfield, doubling the size of the company until its eventual sale to Gentiva Health Services, Inc. in 2006.</p>
					<div class="p-expander">
					<div id="profile-expander4" class="p-expander-content" tabindex="-1">
					<p>In the years following Healthfield’s merger with Gentiva, Mr. Shaner served as Gentiva’s Regional Vice President of the Southeast, the Eastern Division President of the Home Health division, the President of the Hospice division, and Senior Vice President of Operations for the entire company. In this period, Mr. Shaner led the billion-dollar integration of Odyssey Hospice, Inc. and the creation of Gentiva’s Hospice business unit.</p>
					<p>After the sale of Gentiva to Kindred Healthcare in February 2015, Mr. Shaner began providing consulting services to Linden Capital Partners and Blue Wolf Capital concerning multiple post-acute investment opportunities.</p>
					<p>Mr. Shaner joined PSA Healthcare in 2015 as Chief Operating Officer and was instrumental in the formation of Aveanna Healthcare in 2017.</p>
					<p>He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in business finance and economics from the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
