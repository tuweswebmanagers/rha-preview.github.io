			<h3>Information Sharing &amp; Disclosures</h3>
			<p>Aveanna does not sell, lease, rent, trade, or otherwise transfer your Personal Information to third parties. Aveanna may disclose your Personal Information when we believe that a disclosure is appropriate, for example, to comply with the law, to fulfill a business purpose, to enforce our policies, or to protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety.</p>
			<h4>Disclosures to Third Parties</h4>
			<p>Aveanna uses third parties (including contractors, vendors, and service providers) to help with certain aspects of our operations and assist us in providing our services, which may require disclosure of your Personal Information to them. For example, Aveanna may use a third party to communicate with you (via telephone, email, or mail) about our services, to send information to you, to host the Sites and related databases, and to perform other work that we may choose to outsource. Aveanna requires these third parties to use your Personal Information only as necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform, and these third parties must agree to keep this information confidential.</p>
			<p>Non-personally identifiable information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
			<h4>Disclosures Required to Investigate Complaints or by Law Enforcement</h4>
			<p>Aveanna may use Personal Information collected or in its possession to contact users in connection with their inappropriate use of our Sites, noncompliance with our terms and conditions set forth herein, or in connection with a complaint filed about the use of our Sites by another user. Aveanna may disclose your Personal Information to another party, such as law enforcement officials, to comply with legal requirements, court orders, government or law enforcement agency requests; to protect or defend Aveanna; or where we perceive an immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to someone as a result of activity on our Sites. These disclosures may occur under circumstances where we may not be authorized to advise you of such action.</p>
			<h4>Corporate Family</h4>
			<p>We may share some or all of your Personal Information with any current or future affiliate (which means a parent company, subsidiary, joint venturer, or other company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Aveanna), in which case we will require the affiliate to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires Aveanna (or a business unit of Aveanna that uses your Personal Information), the Personal Information collected by Aveanna will be transferred to that company, and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information. The new company’s Privacy Policy may govern further protection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information.</p>

			<h3>Notice For California Residents</h3>
			<p>This section applies only to “Consumers,” which means a natural person who is a California resident as defined by section 17014 of Title 18 of the California Code of Regulations. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”)&nbsp;and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) grant California residents certain additional privacy rights. CCPA&nbsp;&amp; CPRA do not encompass “protected health information” that is governed by HIPAA or “medical information” that is governed by the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. Accordingly, our <a href="HIPAANotice.html">HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices</a> generally will govern HIPAA-protected health information. This section, in contrast, will cover Personal Information about California residents who visit our Sites but are not identifiable as patients, and information on California residents that Aveanna collects or receives but is not subject to HIPAA or the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. This section applies to information that Aveanna collects from Consumers through Sites, third parties, and information it receives offline, including hard copy information. This policy does not apply to Aveanna job applicants, contractors, employees, owners, directors, or officers, where the Personal Information relates to their current, former, or potential role at Aveanna. California job applicants, contract workers, and employees may review <a href="CCPANotice.html#notice-for-job-applicants-contractors-and-employees">Aveanna’s CCPA Notice for Job Applicants, Contractors, and Employees Residing in California</a> for more information.&nbsp;You can click on the following notices for more information: <a href="CCPANotice.html#notice-for-care-providers">Aveanna’s California Employee of Record Care Providers</a> and <a href="CCPANotice.html#notice-for-clients-worksite-employers">Aveanna’s California Client/Worksite Employers</a>.

For any questions regarding this section of the Privacy Policy or about how consumers may exercise their rights, please contact Aveanna by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@aveanna.com">privacy@aveanna.com</a> or calling <a href="tel:8004084442">1-800-408-4442</a>.</p>
			<p>Aveanna has not disclosed to third parties or service providers any Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration. Aveanna does not sell or share Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information as defined by CPRA. Aveanna does not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those specified in section 7027, subsection (m) of the CPRA Regulations. Any reference to Service Providers has the definition provided in section 1798.140, subsection (ae) of CPRA. Affiliates means (1) Aveanna and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (2) any other entity or organization in which Aveanna or a subsidiary owns a direct or indirect equity interest of greater that 50% and (3) any other healthcare entity in which an Aveanna subsidiary either manages or controls the day-to-day operations of the entity.</p>
			<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
			<p>Under CCPA & CPRA, Personal Information means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. Personal Information does not include de-identified or aggregated consumer information. Aveanna retains all Personal Information collected in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and the respective retention periods prescribed therein.</p>

			<h3>How Consumers Can Exercise CCPA and CPRA Rights</h3>
			<h4>Consumers wanting to exercise their rights must submit a <strong>verifiable Consumer request</strong>. To submit a verifiable Consumer request, you can:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Send a written request to Privacy Officer, Aveanna Healthcare, 400 Interstate North Parkway SE, Suite 1600, Atlanta, Georgia 30339</li>
				<li>Send an electronic request: <a href="https://aveannaprivacy.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1">Consumer Privacy Request</a></li>
				<li>Submit a verbal request by calling <a href="tel:8004084442">1-800-408-4442</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Before completing a request, Aveanna must verify that the person making the request is the Consumer about whom Aveanna has Personal Information. Consumers may use an Authorized Agent to submit a verifiable request on the Consumer’s behalf if the Consumer provides the Authorized Agent written permission signed by the Consumer. Aveanna can deny a request from an individual or entity claiming to be an authorized agent that does not provide proof that they have been authorized by the Consumer to act on the Consumer’s behalf.&nbsp;An Authorized Agent is a natural person, or a business entity registered with the Secretary of State to conduct business in California that a Consumer has authorized to act on their behalf subject to the requirements set forth in section 999.2326 of the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations.</p>
			<p>Upon receiving a request to exercise rights under CCPA/CPRA, Aveanna will confirm receipt of the request within 10 business days. Aveanna will respond to requests within 45 calendar days of receipt of a request. If necessary, Aveanna may take up to an additional 45 days to respond to a request, for a maximum total of 90 calendar days from the day the request is received. If Aveanna needs additional time to respond to a request, we will provide the requestor notice and explain  why the additional time is needed. Aveanna may request a Consumer to provide additional information for verification purposes. If Aveanna cannot verify a requestor’s identity, we may deny your request. Aveanna will provide notice to the requestor if we cannot verify the requestor’s identity and comply with the request.</p>
			<p>Household requests – Aveanna currently does not collect household data. If any members of a household initiate a request, we will respond as if the request is an individual request.</p>

			<p>California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Sites who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
