(together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is dependent upon the conduct of its employees, directors, and certain designated agents. When acting on behalf of the Company, each employee, director, and designated agent, as a custodian of the Company’s good name, has a personal responsibility to ensure that his or her conduct is ethical and conforms to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. At the Company, we believe that our achievements to date are a testament to the quality of our people, and that they will be critical to our ongoing success. We seek to hire, retain, and cultivate exceptional people who embody our core values.</p>
				<p>Attached to help all of us is our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”). Our Code is a reaffirmation of the Company’s commitment to conducting its business ethically and to observing applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The Code reminds us of and guides us through the principles and requirements that govern our business and behavior. When representing the Company, each employee, director, and designated agent’s behavior must comply with and promote both the letter of the Code and its spirit of ethical conduct. Your adherence to these ethical principles is fundamental to our future success.</p>
				<p>The Code cannot provide definitive answers to all possible questions. Accordingly, we expect each employee, director, and designated agent to exercise reasonable judgment to determine whether a course of action is consistent with our ethical and legal standards and to seek guidance when appropriate. Your supervisor will often be the person who can provide you with thoughtful, practical guidance in your day-to-day duties. We have also appointed Patrick Cunningham as our Chief Compliance Officer, so you should feel free to ask questions of or seek guidance from him at Patrick.Cunningham@aveanna.com.</p>
				<p>Please read the Code carefully and make sure that you understand it. If you have any questions concerning the Code, please speak with your supervisor or the Compliance Officer. Within five days of reading the Code, please electronically submit your acknowledgment that you have reviewed and understood the Code and agree to abide by its provisions. You will also be asked at least annually in succeeding years to confirm in writing your understanding that your present and continued employment at the Company are conditioned on compliance with the Code, that you have received and reviewed the Code, and have complied with the Code during the preceding calendar year, commencing with the first year following adoption of the Code.</p>
				<p>Finally, I would like to say a big thank you to all of you for everything you do, every day, for the patients, families and communities that you serve with so much care and compassion.</p>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>The Board of Directors of Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) has established this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to aid all the Company’s directors, officers, employees, and certain designated agents in making ethical and legal decisions when conducting the Company’s business and performing their day-to-day duties.</p>
				<p>The Company’s Board of Directors or a committee thereof is responsible for administering the Code. The Board of Directors has delegated day-to-day responsibility for administering and interpreting the Code to a Compliance Officer. Our Chief Compliance Officer has been appointed the Company’s Compliance Officer under this Code. </p>
				<p>The Company expects its directors, officers, employees, and designated agents to exercise reasonable judgment when conducting the Company’s business. The Company encourages its directors, officers, employees, and designated agents to refer to this Code frequently to ensure that they are acting within both its letter and spirit. The Company also understands that this Code will not contain the answer to every situation you may encounter or every concern you may have about conducting the Company’s business ethically and legally. If you have questions or concerns about this Code that are possibly not addressed in this Code, the Company encourages each director, officer, and employee to speak with his or her supervisor (if applicable or appropriate) and/or the Compliance Officer.</p>
				<h3>A Note About Other Obligations</h3>
				<p>The Company’s directors, officers, employees, and designated agents generally have other legal and contractual obligations to the Company. This Code is not intended to reduce or limit the other obligations that they may have to the Company. Instead, the standards in this Code should be viewed as the minimum standards that the Company expects from all of its directors, officers, employees, and certain designated agents in the conduct of the Company’s business.</p>

				<h3>Compliance Process</h3>
				<h4>Where to Go With a Question or Concern or to Report a Violation</h4>
				<p>If you have a question, need an explanation of the Code, or want to know whether a provision of the Code applies to a situation, the best place to start is with your supervisor, the Compliance Department, or the Chief Compliance Officer.</p>
				<p>If you believe any employee is violating the Code or otherwise acting, or potentially acting, in an illegal or unethical manner, you must report it. Doing so shows your sense of responsibility and fairness toward the     Company’s customers and your fellow employees.</p>
				<p>Reporting violations of the Code is also necessary because failure to report a violation may lead to sanctions and disciplinary actions for encouraging, directing, facilitating, or permitting non-compliant behavior. It may also be considered a criminal act..</p>
				<p>Aveanna has disciplinary policies that outline expectations for assisting in the resolution of compliance issues.</p>
				<p>While reporting violations and suspected violations is strongly encouraged, it is unacceptable to knowingly file a false or materially misleading report.</p>
				<p>Potential violations of the Code or other Company policies, or any concerns or complaints, may be reported to the Chief Compliance Officer or the Compliance Department in one of the following ways:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>By mailing a written description of the violation, complaint, or concern to the following address:<br>
						<strong>Aveanna Healthcare</strong><br>
						<address>
						400 Interstate North Parkway SE, Suite 1600<br>
						Atlanta, Georgia 30339<br>
						Attn: Chief Compliance Officer
						</address>
					</li>
					<li>By sending a written description of the violation, complaint, or concern to the following e-mail address:<br>
						<a href="mailto:compliance@aveanna.com">compliance@aveanna.com</a>
					</li>
					<li>By calling the following hotline number and leaving a message describing the violation, complaint, or concern:<br>
						<a href="tel:1-800-408-4442">1-800-408-4442</a>
					</li>
					<li>By reporting the violation, complaint, or concern in person to the Chief Compliance Officer or a Compliance Department team member.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Individuals who are not employees may also report any concerns by using one of the methods above. Potential violations of the Code or other Company policies by the Compliance Department should be reported directly to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee by mailing a written description to the physical address above, Attn: Chairperson of Audit Committee. If you choose, potential violations or concerns may be reported anonymously.</p>

				<h2>Treatment of and Response to Submissions</h2>
				<h3>Review and Response</h3>
				<p>The Chief Compliance Officer and/or a member of the Compliance Department will check the mailbox, e-mail address, and hotline on a regular basis and respond to all submissions where the reporter is contactable. The Chief Compliance Officer, with the assistance of the Compliance Department, will determine the appropriate means of addressing concerns or complaints, and will investigate any reported violations and determine whether any disciplinary and/or other corrective action should be taken.</p>
				<p>The Chief Compliance Officer will report, in writing, on all violations, complaints or concerns contained in the submissions to the Audit Committee in executive session. The Audit Committee will perform an independent and objective assessment of the violations, complaints, or concerns and of any response.</p>
				<p>In appropriate circumstances, the Chief Compliance Officer will have the authority and discretion to bring any submission immediately to the attention of the Audit Committee or to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. In addition to any action taken by the Chief Compliance Officer or the Compliance Department, the Audit Committee will take such action as it deems necessary or appropriate to address any violation, concern, or complaint, including obtaining outside counsel or other advisors to assist the Audit Committee .</p>
				<div role="region" aria-label="Questions and Answers" class="question-block">
					<p><strong>Q:</strong> My office passed out our annual required compliance training tests and assessments with the answers already filled in on the answer key and asked me to just sign my name to the answer sheet. I am not going to take the annual compliance course; I’m just signing my name. Since this is the same test I took on hire, is this okay?</p>
					<p><strong>A:</strong> No . It is never okay to sign your name to something that you did not do . The purpose of the annual compliance course is to remind all employees of their responsibilities regarding compliance. Should this or something like this occur, it is your responsibility to notify the Compliance Department .</p>
				</div>
					
				<h4>Follow-up</h4>
				<p>The Chief Compliance Officer is the designated contact person for individuals who wish to follow up on their submissions. If, after discussion with the Chief Compliance Officer, you are not satisfied with the response to the issue, you may report the matter directly to a member of the Board of Director’s Audit Committee.</p>

				<h4>Documentation of Response</h4>
				<p>Receipt of all non-anonymous submissions will be responded to either orally or in writing unless indicated otherwise. All compliance-related messages left on the hotline and all submissions (written and oral) will be maintained in a confidential file by the Chief Compliance Officer for a minimum of seven years following receipt. The Chief Compliance Officer will also maintain a record of each response, including the date of acknowledgment and any other actions taken. Such records shall be maintained confidentially. Access to the confidential file will be restricted to the Chief Compliance Officer, the Compliance Department, members of the Audit Committee, and individuals specifically designated by the Audit Committee.</p>

				<span id="protection-from-retaliation-or-intimidation" class="anchor-span"></span>
				<h3>Protection from Retaliation or Intimidation</h3>
				<p>Essential to the success of the Code is open communication by all employees of concerns, complaints, and questions relating to any aspect of compliance or business ethics without fear of retribution or retaliation. The Company will not tolerate retaliation or intimidation in any form against any employees who, in good faith, report any concern or illegal or unethical conduct. Any retaliation or intimidation will be cause for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment (of the retaliator). You may report retaliation concerns using the same procedure described above for reporting concerns, complaints, and violations.</p>
				<p>When reporting suspected violations of the Code, the Company prefers that directors, officers, employees and designated agents identify themselves in order to facilitate the Company’s ability to take appropriate steps to address the report, including conducting any appropriate investigation.</p>
				<p>However, the Company also recognizes that some people may feel more comfortable reporting a suspected violation anonymously. If a director, officer, employee, or designated agent wishes to remain anonymous, he or she may do so and the Company will use reasonable efforts to protect the identity of the reporting person, subject to applicable laws, rules, and regulations and to any applicable legal proceedings. In the event the report is made anonymously, however, the Company may not have enough information to investigate or evaluate the allegations. Accordingly, persons who make reports anonymously should provide as much detail as possible to permit the Company to evaluate the matter(s) set forth in the anonymous report and, if appropriate, commence and conduct an appropriate investigation.

You must never destroy or alter any documents or electronic records, lie or mislead an investigator, or obstruct the collection of information relating to an investigation or legal action brought on behalf of, or against, the Company.</p>
				<p>The Company will cooperate with government agencies responsible for investigating suspected violations of law. If requested by the Company, you are also required to cooperate with these agencies.

				<h2>Compliance with the Law</h2>
				<p>The Company is engaged in a highly regulated business, and is subject to various laws, regulations, and rules governing healthcare programs. It is the Company’s policy that its business be conducted in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations in a manner that will reflect a high standard of ethics. The Company requires its employees and agents to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in the locations where the Company does business. Violations of laws and regulations may subject an individual, as well as the Company, to civil and/or criminal penalties.</p>
				<p>In order to comply with the law, employees and agents must learn enough about the laws that affect the Company in order to (a) identify potential issues, (b) know when and where to seek advice, and (c) obtain proper guidance on the correct way to proceed. Employees are strongly encouraged, and have
					an obligation, to raise concerns if they suspect some violation of the law or if they are uncertain as to the proper legal course of action.</p>
				<p>The earlier a potential problem is detected and corrected, the more successful the Company will be in protecting its business and reputation. Where there is any doubt as to the lawfulness of any activity, advice should be sought from the Company’s Chief Compliance Officer, in consultation with the Compliance Department and/or the Legal Department.
</p>
				<p><strong>Perceived pressure from supervisors or demands caused by business conditions are not excuses for violating the law.</strong></p>
				<p>Compliance with the law does not comprise our entire ethical responsibility; rather, it is a minimum essential condition for performance of our duties.</p>
				<p>Failure to comply with the law will be managed in accordance with the Company’s personnel policies.</p>

				<span id="anti-kickback-statute" class="anchor-span"></span>
				<h3>Anti-Kickback Statute</h3>
				<p>Federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are subject to an anti-kickback statute. You    cannot pay a physician, hospital, payer, or vendor either cash or gifts in exchange for referrals of patients, supplies, or item of equipment to the Company. In turn, they cannot pay you to take patients or provide supplies or equipment from them. Also, if you know, or should have known, that an item could induce a purchase by a patient eligible for Medicare or Medicaid, this is also a violation of the anti-kickback statute.</p>
				<p>Violations of this statute may result in the exclusion of the Company from participation in federal healthcare programs. Civil fines can be up to $27,894 per kickback plus three times the amount of the remuneration, and possible criminal felony charges carry a $100,000 fine, ten years imprisonment, or both. There are exceptions (safe harbors) to this statute that reflect reasonable business practices; for example, you can provide refreshments at an open house, give healthcare literature to potential patients, and participate in a public health fair. For possible exceptions, please contact the Compliance Department.</p>

				<p>The Stark Law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to a healthcare provider with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship. In addition, it prohibits healthcare providers from billing for such services. The Stark Law is specific to Medicare and Medicaid; however, similar state laws may apply to private payer patients, and additional Federal laws may apply in these situations.

				<h3>False Claims Act</h3>
				<p>The Federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly making a false claim against the government. False claims can take the form of overcharging for a product or service, delivering less than the promised amount or type of service, underpaying money owed to the government, and charging for one thing but providing another. False claims also occur if a person or entity is excluded from the Medicare/Medicaid program but services from that person or entity are billed nevertheless.</p>
				<p>Many states have also enacted statutes like the Federal False Claims Act, which provide civil remedies for the submission of false and fraudulent claims to state healthcare programs, including Medicaid.

					<p><strong>A:</strong> No. It is never acceptable to backdate documents. Always date the orders for the actual day request and call the Compliance Department. The Company requires all employees to date documentation on the day written. Backdating is never acceptable.</p>

All employees encounter personal health information at some time in their employment with the Company. HIPAA applies whether you work in the field or whether you work at a Company location or service center and  provide billing services. Should you become aware of a breach in the confidentiality of personal health information, you must report it immediately to the Chief Compliance Officer and Privacy Officer, the Compliance Department, or the Security Officer.</p>
				<p>Federal and state laws also require that the Company maintain certain business and patient records for minimum periods of time.

				<h2>Conflicts of Interest and How to Avoid Them</h2>
				<span id="general-guidance" class="anchor-span"></span>
				<h3>General Guidance</h3>
				<p>A “conflict of interest” occurs where an individual’s private interest interferes, or even appears to interfere, with the interests of the Company. Conflicts of interest often occur when you receive an improper personal benefit as a result of your position with the Company.  Relationships with prospective or existing suppliers, contractors, customers, competitors, or regulators must not affect your independent and sound judgment. Business decisions and actions must be based on the best interests of the Company and must not be motivated by personal considerations or relationships.</p>
				<p>In addition to the general need to prevent conflicts of interest, the Company is subject to laws and regulations controlling contractual and other relationships with sources of referrals to the Company or recipients of referrals from the Company. Such matters are discussed in more detail in the Company’s Conflict of Interest Policy. General guidelines to help you better understand several of the most common examples of situations that may cause a conflict of interest are discussed below. Employees are required to disclose to the Chief Compliance Officer or the Compliance Department any situation that may be, or may appear to be, a conflict  of interest.</p>
				<p>Any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest should be reported promptly to the Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer may notify the Board of Directors or a committee thereof as he deems appropriate. Actual or potential conflicts of interest involving a director or executive officer other than the Compliance Officer should be disclosed directly to the Compliance Officer. Actual or potential conflicts of interest involving the Compliance Officer should be disclosed directly to the Chief Executive Officer or to the Chief Legal Officer.</p>

				<p>Any outside activity must be strictly separated from your employment with the Company and should not harm your job performance at the Company.

					<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. Referrals are made to outpatient businesses on a regular basis. A referral to your outpatient therapy business would benefit you financially.

				<h3>Family Members and Close Personal Relationships</h3>
				<p>Employees may not use personal influence to direct Company business to an entity in which any family member or friend has an interest. All employees must disclose to the Chief Compliance Officer (and/or Compliance Department) any interest they hold in any entity doing business with the Company, including interests held by their immediate family (except for ownership of less than 1% of a public corporation). In addition, employees must disclose arrangements like consulting or part-time employment for or other dealings with such an entity. The employment of any family member or friend of an employee by such entity must also be disclosed. Such information will not automatically be regarded as a conflict of interest, but it must be disclosed to allow the Company to determine whether any undue or special influence may appear to be involved. The Company can then decide what action it should take, if any, to safeguard its interests.

Any employees who own any interest in any corporation or entity that directly or indirectly competes with the Company or any division or affiliate of the Company must so advise the Chief Compliance Officer. Any holdings of less than 1% in a public corporation whose stock is regularly traded on a stock exchange do not have to be reported; however, interests held in excess of that amount or in any private entity by an employee or by members of an employee’s immediate family must be disclosed. If there is any doubt about how an investment might be perceived, it should be disclosed to the Chief Compliance Officer and/or Compliance Department.</p>

				<h3> Gifts and Entertainment</h3>
				<p>Small gifts and entertainment can help build relationships with business employees. However, employees must be careful to avoid giving or receiving gifts or entertainment intended to influence their judgment or create a feeling of obligation. No gift or entertainment should ever be offered, given, provided, or accepted by employees or family members of employees unless it (1) is not cash, gift certificates, or other “cash in kind”; (2) is consistent with customary business practices; (3) is not excessive in value; (4) cannot be construed as a bribe or payoff; and (5) does not violate any laws, regulations, or Company policies. Employees may not accept kickbacks, lavish gifts, or gratuities</p>
				<p>Employees may accept items of nominal value, such as small promotional items bearing another company’s name. In some situations, it would be impractical or harmful to refuse or return a gift. When this happens, discuss the situation with the Chief Compliance Officer or a member of the Compliance Department. Some business situations call for giving gifts. The Company’s gifts must be legal, reasonable, and approved by management. Employees may never pay bribes or provide any cash or “cash in kind” to any person. Employees may not provide any gift if it is prohibited by law, Company policy, or the policy of the recipient’s organization.</p>
				<p>In general, employees may accept entertainment that is reasonable in the context of the business. For example, accompanying a business employee to a local cultural or sporting event, or to a business meal, would in most cases be acceptable. Entertainment that is lavish or frequent (such as attending a high-profile sporting event like the Super Bowl or other professional playoff game), may influence your independent judgment. Accepting entertainment that may appear inappropriate should be approved by the Compliance Department in advance of accepting such entertainment. Employees may provide entertainment that is reasonable in the context of the business.</p>
				<p>The giving and receiving of gifts and entertainment are discussed in more detail in the Company’s Policy Manual. Employees, other than directors and officers, should contact the Chief Compliance Officer or the Compliance Department if you have questions about the appropriateness of any gift or entertainment. Directors and officers should discuss such questions and concerns with the Company’s General Counsel and/or the Compliance Department.

				<h2>Political Contributions and Political Lobbying Activity
</h2>
				<p>Political contributions by the Company or in the name of the Company are prohibited without prior approval of the Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Legal Officer. “Political contributions” means direct or indirect payment in support of political candidates, officeholders, or political parties. In addition to cash payments, political contributions are deemed  to include work performed by employees during paid working hours; the purchase of tickets to fundraising events; payment for advertising, printing, or other campaign expenses; and product donations. This policy applies solely to the use of Company assets, such as telephones and computers, and is not intended to discourage or prevent individuals from making political contributions or engaging in political activities on their own behalf, so long as such contributions or activities are not linked in any way to the Company. Employees will not be reimbursed directly or indirectly by the Company for personal political contributions.
</p>
<p>The laws of certain jurisdictions require registration and reporting by anyone who engages in lobbying activity. Generally, lobbying includes the following:
</p>
<ol>
	<li> Communicating with any member or employee of the legislative branch of government for the purpose of influencing legislation.</li>
	<li>Communicating with certain government officials for the purpose of influencing government action.</li>
	<li>Engaging in research or activities to support or prepare such communication.
</li>
</ol>
<p>So that the Company may comply with lobbying laws, employees must notify the Chief Compliance Officer and the Chief Legal Officer before engaging in any activity on behalf of the Company that might be considered lobbying.</p>

You must not take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other practice that constitutes unfair dealing.</p>
				<p>No employee should ever use any illegal or unethical method to gather competitor information. Stealing proprietary information, possessing trade secret information that was obtained without consent, or inducing such disclosures by past or present employees of other companies is prohibited.

				<h2>Antitrust Laws</h2>
				<p>Aveanna is committed to full compliance with the antitrust laws. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) enforce these laws that regulate conduct by corporations to promote fair competition. Violations of antitrust laws may result in higher prices, lower quality, and fewer goods or services available in the market. The antitrust laws are intended to level the playing field and prohibit companies from engaging in restrictive practices that limit fair competition. Practices such as price-fixing, bid-rigging, boycotting, sharing certain intellectual property, and monopolies are examples of arrangements that unfairly affect consumers. In an open, competitive market, consumers should have the free choice of price, selection, and service. Penalties for violating antitrust laws can be both criminal and civil in nature. If you have questions or concerns around these types of activities, please reach out to the Compliance and Legal Departments for guidance.</p>
				 
				<p>In addition to the antitrust laws, Aveanna is subject to Regulation Fair Disclosure (“Regulation FD”). This law is intended to promote fair dealing and prohibits the selective disclosure of certain information. Regulation FD provides that if Aveanna decides to disclose material non-public information to certain stakeholders such as investors, stock analysts or other market professionals, we must also make the same information available to the general public at the same time. Aveanna will never use any illegal or unethical method to gain a market advantage. Employees who question whether a contemplated action may violate fair competition laws should consult the Compliance Department or Legal Department.</p>

To assist the Audit Committee in this undertaking, the Company has established the senior management position of Chief Compliance Officer and a separate Compliance Committee. Among other things, the Chief Compliance Officer is charged with monitoring compliance with the Code and all federal healthcare programs. The Company’s Compliance Committee is comprised of various members of senior management from different business functions within the Company and is primarily charged with the review of compliance matters and supporting the Chief Compliance Officer in fulfillment of his or her duties.</p>
				<h3>Be Proactive</h3>
				<p>Every director, officer, employee, and designated agent is expected to act proactively by asking questions, seeking guidance, and reporting suspected violations of the Code and other policies and procedures of the Company, as well as any violation or suspected violation of applicable laws, rules, or regulations arising in the conduct of the Company’s business or occurring on the Company’s property. If any director, officer, employee, or designated agent believes that actions have taken place, may be taking place, or may be about to take place that violate or would violate the Code or any laws, rules, or regulations applicable to the Company, he or she must bring the matter to the attention of the Company.</p>
				<h3>Seeking Guidance</h3>
				<p>The best starting point for a director, officer, employee, or designated agent seeking advice on ethics related issues or reporting potential violations of the Code will usually be his or her supervisor. However, if the conduct in question involves his or her supervisor; if the director, officer, employee, or designated agent has reported the conduct in question to his or her supervisor and does not believe that he or she has dealt with it properly; or if the director, officer, employee, or designated agent does not feel that he or she can discuss the matter with his or her supervisor, he or she should raise the matter with the Compliance Officer.</p>
				<h3>Communication Alternatives</h3>
				<p>Once again, potential violations of the Code or other Company policies, concerns, or complaints may be reported to the Chief Compliance Officer or the Compliance Department in one of the following ways:</p>
	
			<ol>
				<li>By mailing a written description of the violation, complaint, or concern to the following address:

				<h2>The Use of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
				<p>Artificial intelligence is defined as the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. The rapidly expanding use of AI in health care can enhance various aspects of healthcare delivery, including, improve and predict patient/clinical outcomes, improve assessment and screening for appropriate care, personalize treatment, improve patient engagement, streamline administrative tasks and ease the burden of clinical documentation. Aveanna is committed to ensuring that AI is utilized in safe, legal, ethical and effective ways that comply with our policies. </p>
				<p>Guidelines for responsible use of AI at Aveanna:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Be aware of the potential risks across lines of business to guard against over or under-utilization of resources or services, data breaches, inattention based on over-reliance on automation and/or predictive technology. Ask questions if you do not understand an AI-generated recommendation or output. Clinical as well as non-clinical uses of AI should follow these general guidelines.</li>
					<li>Remember that AI is an assistive tool that augments human clinical decision-making capabilities but does not replace them. The clinician and clinical team remains in control of health-care decisions, the plan of care and other clinically driven care decisions. </li>
					<li>Although AI technology may perform, automate or expedite specific tasks, it remains the responsibility of the clinician and clinical team to ensure that the tasks are carried out and documented appropriately. </li>
					<li>Clinicians are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of documentation and the clinical record and should not include any AI-generated text in the record or sign off on changes to the record without reviewing for accuracy. </li>
					<li>New uses of AI technologies must go through existing approval channels and/or vendor deployment, ensuring quality testing and review by Information Security, Compliance and other stakeholders.</li>

				<p>In addition to the foregoing methods, a director also can communicate concerns or seek advice with respect to this Code by contacting the Board of Directors through its Chair or the Audit Committee.</p>
				<p>Individuals who are not employees may also report concerns regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, and auditing matters by using one of the methods above. Potential violations of the Code or other Company policies by the Compliance Department should be reported directly to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee by mailing a written description to the physical address above, Attn: Chairperson of Audit Committee. If you choose, potential violations or concerns may be reported anonymously.</p>
				<p>Aveanna Healthcare is committed to following all laws and  regulations related to legal, ethical, and compliance matters, but the only way we can do this is to depend on our employees, officers, and directors to do the right thing.</p>
