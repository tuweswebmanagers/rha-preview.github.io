			</ol>
			<h3>How Consumers Can Exercise CCPA and CPRA Rights</h3>
			<h4>Consumers wanting to exercise their rights must submit a <strong>verifiable Consumer request</strong>. To submit a verifiable Consumer request, you can:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Send a written request to Privacy Officer, Aveanna Healthcare, 400 Interstate North Parkway SE, Suite 1600, Atlanta, Georgia 30339</li>
				<li>Send an electronic request: <a href="https://aveannaprivacy.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1">Consumer Privacy Request</a></li>
				<li>Submit a verbal request by calling <a href="tel:8004084442">1-800-408-4442</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Before completing a request, Aveanna must verify that the person making the request is the Consumer about whom Aveanna has Personal Information. Consumers may use an Authorized Agent to submit a verifiable request on the Consumer’s behalf if the Consumer provides the Authorized Agent written permission signed by the Consumer. Aveanna can deny a request from an individual or entity claiming to be an authorized agent that does not provide proof that they have been authorized by the Consumer to act on the Consumer’s behalf.&nbsp;An Authorized Agent is a natural person, or a business entity registered with the Secretary of State to conduct business in California that a Consumer has authorized to act on their behalf subject to the requirements set forth in section 999.2326 of the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations.</p>
			<p>Upon receiving a request to exercise rights under CCPA/CPRA, Aveanna will confirm receipt of the request within 10 business days. Aveanna will respond to requests within 45 calendar days of receipt of a request. If necessary, Aveanna may take up to an additional 45 days to respond to a request, for a maximum total of 90 calendar days from the day the request is received. If Aveanna needs additional time to respond to a request, we will provide the requestor notice and explain  why the additional time is needed. Aveanna may request a Consumer to provide additional information for verification purposes. If Aveanna cannot verify a requestor’s identity, we may deny your request. Aveanna will provide notice to the requestor if we cannot verify the requestor’s identity and comply with the request.</p>
			<p>Household requests – Aveanna currently does not collect household data. If any members of a household initiate a request, we will respond as if the request is an individual request.</p>
			<h3>Other California Privacy Rights</h3>
			<p>California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Sites who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
